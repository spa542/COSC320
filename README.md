## Course Overview:
This course will cover in depth algorithm complexity analysis, algorithm design
techniques (greedy, divide and conquer, dynamic programming), and efficient algorithms for various problems
will be introduced. Advanced data structures such as hash tables, binary search trees, and red-black trees
will be studied. The complexity classes P and NP will also be covered.

## Primary Languages Used:
* C++
## Other Important Libraries/Applications Used:
* Linear Algebra 3rd party libraries
* Big Integer Libraries
* C++ Color Libraries

## Main Projects
### Project 1 Leiontif's Econ I/O Model:
#### Author: Ryan Rosiak
#### Description:
This project implements matrix operations such as inverse, multiplication, and finding the determinant to demonstrate Leiontif's Econ I/O Model. (See Description of the model in 
the project folder)
### Project 2 Hash Dictionary Auto-Correct:
#### Author: Ryan Rosiak
#### Description:
This project uses a manually made hash table using a linked list to store parsed words from sentences input by the user. The program takes the unrecognized words (i.e. words not 
found in the has table) and finds other words that are "close to" it when various changes are made to the word such as inserting or removing letters.
### Project 3 Task Scheduling Research:
#### Authors: Ryan Rosiak and Grant Dawson
#### Description:
This research project dives deep into the topic of task scheduling in a cpu. Graph algorithsm to compute data attributes of a DAG are used in order to figure out what tasks should
be scheduled to what processor when and in what order. Currently, this project is being hosted on my [partner's github](https://github.com/dawsboss/COSC-320-Project-3).
