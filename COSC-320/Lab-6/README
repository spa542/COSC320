Lab Description:
This lab demonstrates the timing complexity of the randomized algorithms the hiring 
problem and the randomized quick sort. These are compared to other sorts prior to 
test their running time. This lab implements these functions as well as takes their
average time to complete in order to gauge a good idea of how well they run in 
practice.

Files to pay attention to:

main.o - This is the compilation linker file

main - Output file that is run when the program is executed by the user

Makefile - File that allows the user to compile without having to input specific 
commands

Makefile Instructions:
Type "make" without the quotes and the program will compile everything for you.
Then proceed with using ./main in order to run the program.

Instructions for Program:

Follow the Makefile instructions above to run the program without any manual work. If
not using Makefile, then you must compile the .cpp files into .o files.
(g++ -c main.cpp) Then you must link those with a final compilation all while labeling
the output file as main.
**You must use -std=c++11 within your compilation steps
